<p>我特別幸運。熱情，投入和有意義。這幾個詞我用來概括我過去 22 年一直在做的事情。每當談論起我做的事，就是幫助別人追求和獲得職業成功，我都會簡單直白地告訴他們：我註定要做這一行。</p>
<p>但一開始，我並沒有從事我現在的工作。我的職業生涯的頭 10 年（算上我讀大學的時間），我對我做的事情毫無熱情，也不投入。我學的是機械工程，畢業後入職一家大型玩具公司（Mattel）當研發設計工程師。其實，對很多人而言，做研發，做工程設計，製造玩具都是不錯的職業選擇。可我除外。</p>
<p>因此，我開始尋找能讓我更享受其中的事情，但在當時，我毫無頭緒。八年後，我終於找到了這件事。在我的尋找過程中，我做了幾件很重要的事情，在本文最後附上的文章中我專門寫了這些事。不過在這裏，我主要想強調兩大點。</p>
<p><strong>1) 三大要素&mdash;</strong>&mdash;<strong>要問我做過最重要的事情是什麼？我想說，是走上一條與我的關注點和興趣點最爲契合的道路。</strong>在職業生涯早期，想要確認自己究竟想做什麼，這幾乎是不可能的。你初出茅廬，哪懂什麼叫現實？你沒什麼經驗，沒接觸過什麼事情，哪能知道有多少種可能，有多少種選擇？哪能知道某件事到底是怎樣的？</p>
<p><strong>所以，我仔細思考了在未來工作或職業中最希望出現的三件事，並將其稱爲&ldquo;三大要素&rdquo;。確定好這些要素並銘記於腦海，你就能避免不感興趣的、對你沒多大意義的工作和職業，更好地追逐你感興趣的、覺得有意義的工作。</strong></p>
<p>例如，在我二十五歲時，我爲自己確定了這三大要素。</p>
<p>1)<strong> 商務&mdash;</strong>&mdash;儘管當時我還不太瞭解這個詞，但與工程製造相比，我對商務的興趣要大得多。我非常喜歡做有益於他人的事情，爲他人提供價值。我對做成這件事所需的其他事情也很感興趣，例如領導力、戰略思維、市場營銷等。</p>
<p>2)<strong> 幫助他人</strong>&mdash;&mdash;身爲一個研發設計工程師，大多數時候，我都坐在電腦前。我不想過這種生活。雖然當時我很羞澀，但我還是喜歡和人交流，激勵他人，表現出最好的自己。因此，無論我以後想從事何種職業，我都希望這份職業能涉及與人交往，以及影響他人人生的事情。</p>
<p>3)<strong> 中國&mdash;</strong>&mdash;我之前寫過這一點，但我的首次中國行改變了我的人生。我一直稱這次旅行爲&ldquo;覺醒之旅&rdquo;。在這次旅行中，我感受到身爲中國人內心涌動的驕傲、感激和謙遜之情。這是我以前在美國從沒感受到過的。雖然那時我還不會說普通話，對中國社會和文化也知之甚少，但我知道，在未來的某一天，我想參與到這個國家的發展中去。</p>
<p>我花了幾個月的時間苦思冥想，捫心自問，最後終於確定了這三大要素。明確了這三大要素後，我更加明白了哪些事情對我最爲重要，哪條道路纔是我未來想要前進的方向。回顧我這二十幾年的職業生涯，你會發現，在我做的每個工作舉措和職業決定中，你都能看到這三大要素的身影。</p>
<p>因爲我把它們銘記於心，所以我拒絕了工資更高，頭銜更響亮，但歸根結底還是不適合我的工作。反而那些從前我從不覺得會感興趣，甚至考慮都不考慮的工作，恰恰因爲這三大要素進入了我的視線，在我選擇工作和公司時幫了我一把。創業並投身於人才招聘行業二十餘年，這便是很好的例證。事實說明，這與我的三大要素相當契合。</p>
<p>因此我的建議是：想一想你最希望今後的職業生涯涉及哪些事情，然後根據這些事情確定好三大要素。</p>
<p><strong>2) 他們不是你！</strong>&mdash;&mdash;人們之所以落入不適合自己的工作和職業生涯，一大原因就是因爲聽信了其他人的建議。這些人常常是你的父母、親戚、老師、朋友或同事。他們也確實關心你的成功和幸福，在給職業建議時也是真心真意的。</p>
<p>在傾聽職業建議時，要懷抱開放的心態，感激關心你成功和未來的所有人。但與此同時，你還得記住：<em>他們不是你</em>。<strong>首先，你應該比所有人更瞭解你自己，</strong>尤其是個人喜好，享受做什麼，不享受什麼，關心什麼，不關心什麼。工作和職業建議沒有好壞對錯之分，它們只與你看重的事情有關。</p>
<p>第二，<strong>給職業建議很容易，</strong>但採取了別人的建議後，你發現這是個錯誤的選擇，怎麼辦？要去做這份你不喜歡的工作，進這家你不喜歡的公司，每天做自己不喜歡的事情的人不是他們，是你。他們只會說：&ldquo;好吧，我可能想錯了。&rdquo;<strong>聽信了他們的建議，做出了錯誤的選擇，承擔後果的是你，不是他們。</strong></p>
<p>最後一點，<strong>沒人逼你一定要做某份工作，從事某份職業。</strong>這些都是你的選擇。因此，要想最終能選到做自己喜歡做的事情，<strong>那就成熟起來，明白一個道理&mdash;&mdash;<em>這是你的職業，這是你的責任</em>。</strong>不要根據別人的觀點澤野，要選擇自己認爲適合自己的工作和職業。</p>
<p>拿我自己舉例，我的父親是個工程師，他希望我也能當個工程師，因此，我選擇了這條路。另外，我母親從事的工作與公共健康相關，她希望我當名醫生。我叔叔是位律師，他覺得我以後也能當個好律師。我的前任老闆熱愛 IT 行業，所以他總是在我面前說 IT 行業有多麼多的機會。他們的建議都是有道理的，只不過都不適合我。</p>
<p>最近我在一個文章裏寫了&ldquo;<strong><em>年輕時找不到自己的熱情所在，怎麼辦？</em></strong>&rdquo;（<a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28523697">年輕時找不到自己的熱情所在，怎麼辦？</a>）。在那個回答中，我強調了能幫你找到真正想做之事的其他幾個關鍵要素，比如&ldquo;沒有熱情，就大膽離開&rdquo;，&ldquo;與儘可能多的人交流&rdquo;，&ldquo;克服恐懼&rdquo;和&ldquo;享受旅程&rdquo;。最後我想說，<strong>找到最適合的職業情形並沒有完美答案，也沒有捷徑和小竅門。它源於一次又一次的整體職業決定和一個又一個工作決定，還有一份渴望追逐最適合自己的事情的堅定決心。</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very lucky. Passionate, dedicated, and meaningful. These are the words I use to describe how I feel about what I&rsquo;ve been doing every day for the past 22 years. When talking about what I do, which is helping people to pursue and achieve their career success, I simply tell others that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I was meant to do.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t start out this way though. For the first 10 years of my career (counting my university degree), I did something I had no passion for and little dedication towards. I studied mechanical</p>
<p>engineering and became an R&amp;D design engineer for a major toy company (Mattel). Actually, doing R&amp;D or engineering design work, and making toys for a living, are great careers for many people. Just not for me.</p>
<p>So I began searching for what I would enjoy more, with no idea what that might be. After eight years, I found it. There are several key things I did during my search that I&rsquo;ve written about in another article that I&rsquo;ll mention later. But here are two big things I&rsquo;ll highlight now.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><strong>Three elements &ndash; The most important thing I did? Point myself in a direction that was true and consistent with what I care about and am most interested in.</strong> But early in your</p>
<p>career, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to identify what it is that you want to do. What do you know about the real world yet? What experience and exposure do you have so far to tell you what possibilities and options are out there, or even what something is really about?</p>
<p><strong>So I thought about what I call my <em>three elements, </em>or three things I most wanted<br>to be part of any job or career situation I pursued. By identifying and then always keeping these elements in mind, you&rsquo;ll avoid job and career situations that<br>you&rsquo;re not that interested in and that aren&rsquo;t that meaningful to you, and<br>better pursue ones that are.</strong></p>
<p>For example, these are the three elements I identified for myself back in my mid-20s.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Business -</strong> Although I didn&rsquo;t understand it well, I was much more interested in the business world than engineering/manufacturing world. I liked the whole idea of building something that benefited or provided value to others. I was also very interested in the things that it took to</p>
<p>achieve this, like leadership, strategic thinking, and marketing.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Helping people </strong>&ndash; As an R&amp;D design engineer, I sat in front of a computer most of the day. Not what I wanted to do. Although I was shy, I liked talking to people. And doing things that helped others energized and brought out the best in me. So whatever I pursued for my career, I wanted it to involve dealing with people and doing something that impacted the lives of others.</p>
<p>3) <strong>China &ndash;</strong> I&rsquo;ve written about this before, but my first time to China changed my life. I always</p>
<p>refer to the trip as, an awakening. During the trip, I felt a sense of pride, appreciation, and humility about being Chinese that I&rsquo;d never felt before in the U.S. Although I didn&rsquo;t speak Mandarin and knew little about Chinese society and culture, I knew I wanted to be a part of this country&rsquo;s development and future someday.</p>
<p>It took me a couple months of pondering and soul-searching to identify my three elements. But once I did, they gave me a clear sense of what was most important to me and the direction I wanted to go. Look at my career over the years and you&rsquo;ll see these elements in every job move and career decision I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>By always keeping them in mind, I&rsquo;ve avoided jobs that offered more money and with famous</p>
<p>companies that, ultimately, weren&rsquo;t the right fit for me. They&rsquo;ve also helped me choose jobs and join companies that I never thought I&rsquo;d be interested in or even consider. Being an entrepreneur and in the recruitment and talent industry here for 20+ years are good examples. Turns out, these fit my three elements extremely well.</p>
<p>So what I highly recommend is, identify the three elements that you hope can always be</p>
<p>part of what you pursue for your career.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><strong>They&rsquo;re not you</strong>! &ndash; A big reason many people end up in jobs and careers that don&rsquo;t fit them is because they listened to the advice of someone else. Usually, it&rsquo;s your parents, relatives, teachers, friends, or colleagues who genuinely care about your success and happiness, and are sincere in their career advice to you.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing about career advice. Be open to it, and appreciate anyone who takes an interest in your success and future. But also remember, <em>they&rsquo;re not you.</em><strong>First of all, nobody<br>should know you better than yourself. </strong>Especially, what you like/dislike, enjoy doing/don&rsquo;t enjoy doing, and care/don&rsquo;t care about. Job and career decisions aren&rsquo;t about good or bad, right or wrong. They&rsquo;re relative to what&rsquo;s important to you!</p>
<p>Second, <strong>giving career advice is easy. </strong>But follow someone&rsquo;s advice that ends up being wrong, it&rsquo;s not them who has to show up at a job or company they don&rsquo;t like, or do something every day that they don&rsquo;t enjoy. It&rsquo;s you. They can just go, &ldquo;Oh well, I guess I was wrong.&rdquo; <strong>But you&rsquo;re the one who has to suffer the consequences of your bad decision, based on their advice.</strong></p>
<p>And finally, <strong>nobody forces you to take a certain job or pursue a certain career. </strong>These are your decisions. So to end up doing something you like, <strong>be mature enough to recognize that, <em>it&rsquo;s your career, your responsibility</em>.</strong> Make job and career decisions that you believe fit you,</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t based on someone else&rsquo;s idea of what might.</p>
<p>In my case, my dad&rsquo;s an engineer who wanted me to become an engineer too. That&rsquo;s why I chose engineering. In addition, my mom, who&rsquo;s in public health, wanted me to become a doctor. My uncle&rsquo;s a lawyer who thought I&rsquo;d make a good lawyer too. My previous boss loved the IT industry, so was always mentioning IT opportunities to me. Their advice was all reasonable, just not the right for me. What ended up being right for me is what I do now, which is based on my own view of myself and what kind of success I want to achieve for my career and in my life.</p>
<p>I recently posted another Zhihu article, <strong><em>How A Person With No Passion In His Career Pursued And Found His Passion &lt;</em></strong><a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28523697">年輕時找不到自己的熱情所在，怎麼辦？</a><em><strong> &gt;</strong>.</em> In it, I highlighted a few other key things that will help you find what you really want to do. For instance, <em>leaving what you have no passion for, talking to as many people as you can, overcoming &ldquo;the fear&rdquo;, and enjoying the journey. </em>In the end, <strong>there are no magic answers, no quick and easy processes for getting<br>into the right career situation for yourself. It&rsquo;s a result of the overall career decisions and specific job choices you make, and your determination to pursue what&rsquo;s most suited for you.</strong></p>
